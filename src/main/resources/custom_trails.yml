# Custom trails define a set of points in 3d space, which may move with the player in some

  # How should the set of points move relative to the player?
  #   absolute:
  #     Default. Do not move the points relative to the player (i.e. use world space).
  #     Centers on the floor under the player.
  #   body:
  #     Move the points relative to the player's body, rotating about the Y axis
  #     when they look left or right, but not when they look up or down.
  #     Centers on the middle of the player (including sneak height change)
  #   head:
  #     Move the points relative to the player's head, including looking up and down.
  #     Centers on the middle of the player's head.
